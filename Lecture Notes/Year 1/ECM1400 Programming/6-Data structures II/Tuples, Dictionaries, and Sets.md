### Tuples

Tuples are immutable sequences
(a1, a2, a3)


### Dictionaries

Constructed from keys and values

```python
dict = {'key1' : 'value1', 'key2' : 'value2'}
```

To access the values used the key as an index, e.g.
```python
dict[key1] = value1
```



### Sets

Unordered sequences in which all elements are unique

```python
set = {a, b, c, d, e}

{a, b, b} == {a, b}
```
