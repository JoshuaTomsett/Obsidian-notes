a declarative sentence this is either `true or false`

##### Compound Propositions

###### Implication

p$\implies$q 

![[Pasted image 20221013203427.png]]

p is the hypothesis
q is the conclusion

it is the same as : $\neg$p $\lor$ q

Converse : q$\implies$p

Contrapositive : ¬q$\implies$¬p

Inverse : ¬p$\implies$¬q

###### Biconditional

p$\iff$q

p if and only if q

##### Terminology and Precedence

Tautology : a propostition that is always true

Contradiction : a proposition that is always false

Contingency : a proposition which is neither a tautology nor a contradiction such as p

### Propositional Equivalences

Two propositions are equivilent, denoted p $\equiv$ q if they always have the same truth value

##### Equivalence Laws
