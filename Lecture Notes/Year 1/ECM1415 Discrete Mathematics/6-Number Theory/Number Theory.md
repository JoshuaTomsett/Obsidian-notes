### Divisibility and Modular Arithmetic

##### Division

a $\mid$ b denotes a divides b, or (b / a)

- a is a factor or divisor of b
- b is a multiple of a
- if a does not divide b, we write a $\nmid$ b


##### Division Algorithm

if a is an integer and d a positive integer, then there are unique integers q and r, such that

$a = qd + r$

- d - divisor
- a - divident
- q - quoitient
- r - remainder

### Prime numbers

A positive integer greater than 1 that has only the factors of 1 and itself


#### Fundimental Theorem of Arithmetic

Every positive integer can be written uniquely as a prime or as the product of two or more primes
