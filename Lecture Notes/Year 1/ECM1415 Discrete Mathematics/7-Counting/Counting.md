### Basic Counting Principles

##### The Product Rule

A procedure can be broken down into a sequence of two tasks. There are $n_1$ ways to do the first task and $n_2$ ways to do the second task. Then there are $n_1 âˆ— n_2$ ways to do the procedure

##### The Sum Rule

If a task can be done either in one of n1 ways or in one of $n_2$, where none of the set of $n_1$ ways is the same as any of the $n_2$ ways, then there are $n_1 + n_2$ ways to do the task

##### The Subtraction Rule

If a task can be done either in one of $n_1$ ways or in one of $n_2$, then the total number of ways to do the task is $n_1 + n_2$ minus the number of ways to do the task that are common to the two different ways

##### The Division Rule

There are $n/d$ ways to do a task if it can be done using a procedure that can be carried out in $n$ ways, and for every way $w$, exactly $d$ of the $n$ ways correspond to way $w$.


### The Pigeonhole Principle
