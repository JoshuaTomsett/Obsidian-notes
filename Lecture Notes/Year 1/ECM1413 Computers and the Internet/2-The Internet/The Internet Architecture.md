### Payload and Headers

### Hosts

A host is a computer connected to a computer network

The term host comes from the time when all computers on a network had to "host" an interface message processor (IMP)


### LAN

A Local Area Network consists of a switching device, to which hosts are directly connected

The risk of failure is relatively small


### WAN

A Wide Area Network consists of connected switching devices, to which local area networks are directly connected

The risk of failure is larger than in a LAN


### Switching devices

- Switches
- Routers


#### Switches

##### MAC Addresses

The MAC address can be changed for privacy reasons, to bypass firewalls, etc


#### Routers

##### Forwarding Tables

Routers periodically exchange routing protocol messages which contain routing metrics. Based on these, each router computes a forwarding table which contains a valid next hop route for each possible destination address.


### Connection Technologies

#### Twisted-Pair cable
