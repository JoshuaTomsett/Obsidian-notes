### Ethics and Moral Theories

Ethics - the philosophical study of morality

Morality relates to beliefs involving right/wrong, good/bad
- Descriptive: certain codes of conduct put forward by a society or group
- Normative: a code of conduct that would be put forward by all rational people

##### The Universalizability Principle

A moral statement that applies in one situation must apply in all other situations that are relevantly similar

##### The Principle of Impartiality

All persons are considered equal and should be treated accordingly

##### The Dominance of Moral Norms

Moral norms dominate other norms such as legal norms and aesthetic norms

e.g: civil disobedience is often justified when laws are in conflict with moral norms


### Ethical Theories

A moral theory is an explanation of what makes an action right or what makes a person good

Moral theories can be grouped into two major categories:
- consequentialist
- nonconsequentialist

#### Consequentialist

Claims that what makes an action right is its consequences

The rightness of an action depends on the amount of good it produces

e.g: utilitarianism / ethical egoism

#### Nonconsequentialist

Claims that whether an action is right or wrong depends primarily on the nature of the action itself

e.g: Kantian ethics / natural law theory
