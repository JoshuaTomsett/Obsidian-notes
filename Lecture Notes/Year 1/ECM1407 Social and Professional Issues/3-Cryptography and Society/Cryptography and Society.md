Moore's Law : the number of transistors on microchips doubles every two years

Modern Cryptography : The study of mathematical techniques for securing digital information, 
systems, and distributed computations against adversarial attacks

#### Caesar's cipher

- one of the oldest recorded ciphers
- works by shifting each letter n places forward

#### Sufficient key-space principle

- Any secure encryption scheme must have a key space that is sufficiently large to make an exhaustive-search attack infeasible 

#### Mono-alphabetic substitution cipher

- defines a map each letter to some other letter of the alphabet

#### Symmetric Encryption

- both parties have the same private key
- requires a key exchange, which can be difficult

#### Asymmetric Encryption

- uses public and private keys

#### RSA

#### Digital Certificate

- a certificate authority can issue a digital certificate to prove the ownership of a public key

#### How to break it 

- Quantum computing - Shor's algorithm
	- polynomial-time quantum computer algorithm for integer factorization

- Brute force

- Cryptanalysis

- Side-channel attack
	- Timing
	- Power-monitoring

- Heartbleed bug

- DROWN Attack

#### TOR

The Onion Router

#### Zimmermann's Law

The ability of computers to track us doubles every eighteen months

#### Edward Snowden

Leaked infomation on different surveillance programs

#### End-to-end Encryption

- Messages and files are encrypted before they leave the device and are only decrypted when they reach their destination

- can be used to hide criminal activity

- Some contries have banned apps like WhatsApp for this reason
