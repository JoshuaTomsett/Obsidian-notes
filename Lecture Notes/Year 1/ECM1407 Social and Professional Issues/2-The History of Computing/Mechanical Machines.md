Antikythera mechanism : oldest example of an analogue computer

### The differenece engine

- created by Charles Babbage
- funded by the british government (Â£1700) in 1823
- Babbage hired a toolmaker Joseph Clement to help him build it
- a working prototype was completed in 1832
- in 1834 Babbage and Clement had an argument and construction is halted

### The analytical engine

- described by Babbage to be a general-purpose programmable computer
- this was done in 1837

### The difference engine No. 2

- developed by Babbage from 1847 - 1849

### Ada Lovelace

- the first computer programmer (note G)
- while translating a french paper written by Luigi Menabrea she added a note about how to use the analytical engine to calculate Bernoulli numbers

### Wilhelm Gottfried Leibniz

- in 1703, Leibniz described how binary numbers may be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided
- he also developed the concept of formal symbolic logic

### Charles Boole

- developed the concept of using symbols to represent objects (x = sheep)

### Claude Shannon

- provided mathematical techniques for building a network of switches to realize a specificlogical function (an electrical circuit that works only if the right combination of buttons is pressed)
