### Computer Models

A computer model (or simulation) is a system designed to predict the behaviour or outcome of a real-world phenomenon

e.g: weather modelling / population growth

All models are wrong, but some are useful

When we see a model, we should ask:
- how well do the modelers understand the underlying science or theory of the system they are modelling
- what are the assumptions and simplifications in the model
- how closely so the model predictions correspond with the results from real experience

Limits of models:
- Uncertainty (e.g: predicting a coin flip)
- the coin does not have memory, so the prediction is useless


### Healthcare and the Judicial System

models can be used for:
- Patient prioritization
- Predicting recidivism (commit crime again)

problems:
- bias (racial - e.g: predict black people will re commit crime)


### The Future: Explainable AI

Explainable AI consists of a set of tools/frameworks that enable us to understand and interpret the predictions made by models

Example - Prototypical structures:

### Black Boxes

A black box is a device or system which produces useful infomation without revealing any infomation about its internal workings
